# Tricopter-Drone
A low cost and high endurance tricopter drone, long range (upto 1 KM!) radio controller and a servo-based gimbal project. <br /> 

## DEMO
* Flight test without gimbal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D84rRaGhg_E  <br />
* Flight test with gimbal installed : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px0To0RRc_0&feature=youtu.be <br /> 
* Video recording using a smartphone(installed on the gimbal): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPNyg-K_iaE <br />

## ABOUT
This TRI-COPTER is built using arduino(atmega328p) as flight controller, arduino as radio receiver as well as for the transmitter also an arduino microcontroller is used. This is a total scratch build by me. The frame is made using PVC casing pipes which is both light weight and strong which resulted in high endurance time and durability. <br />
Motors: 3x Brushless A2212 1000kv  <br />
Flight-controller: Arduino nano with Multiwii 2.4 <br />
IMU: MP6050 <br />
Transmitter: Arduino nano with NRF24 with PA and LNA <br />
Receiver: atmega328 with NRF24 <br />
Tail have an 9gm servo motor for yaw control. <br />
Frame: PVC casing pipes and wood. <br />
